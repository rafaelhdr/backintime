List only different Snapshots

List only equal Snapshots to

If checked only Snapshots with file versions equal to the Snapshot on the right will be shown below.

Deep check

Calculate checksums to decide if file versions are equal or different with `List only different Snapshots` or `List only equal Snapshots to`. This takes a lot more time but is more accurate, too.

Restore

Restore the file/folder from the selected Snapshot. Will be grayed out if `Now` or multiple Snapshots are selected.

Delete

Delete the file/folder from one or multiple selected Snapshots. Will be grayed out if `Now` is selected.

Select All

Select all Snapshots except `Now`.

Snapshots

Lists all Snapshots which contain the file/folder. Can be filtered with `List only different Snapshots` or `List only equal Snapshots to`.

Diff

Open a Side-by-Side view of the file/folder in the Snapshot above and the Snapshot in the right hand selection.

Diff Options

Change the Program which is used for the Side-by-Side view with `Diff`. You can use `%1` and `%2` for the paths of both Snapshots.

Go To

Return to the Main Window and show the file in the above selected Snapshot.
