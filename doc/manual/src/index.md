*Back In Time* is a backup solution for GNU/Linux desktops. It is based on
`rsync` and uses hard links to reduce space used for unchanged files. It comes
with a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command line interface (CLI).

Backups are stored in plain text. They can be browsed with a normal
file-browser or in terminal which makes it possible to restore files even
without _Back In Time_. Files ownership, group and permissions are stored in a
separate compressed plain text file (`fileinfo.bz2`). If the backup drive does
not support permissions _Back In Time_ will restore permissions from
`fileinfo.bz2`. So if you restore files without _Back In Time_, permissions
could get lost.
