# Overview

The project distinguish between three types of documentation:

1. The **User manual** can be found at
   [backintime.readthedocs.io](http://backintime.readthedocs.io) and is
   generated using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) based on simple
   [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files.
2. The **Source Code documentation** is located at 
   [backintime-dev.readthedocs.io](http://backintime-dev.readthedocs.io) and
   generated from the Python source files using
   [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) (migration to
   [PyDoctor](https://pydoctor.readthedocs.io) is planned).
3. The **Maintenance and Developer documentation** is a bunch of Markdown
   files, like the one you are reading currently.


# Build & view user manual (MkDocs)

Install related dependencies:
  - `mkdocs`
  - `mkdocs-material`
  - See file [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) in this repo for a
    complete and up to date list of dependencies.

**Live preview HTML documentation as working on it**:

```sh
# Enter folder
$ cd doc/manual

# Start built-in server
$ mkdocs serve
```
Open [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser. Every time the
underlying markdown files are modified the server will on the fly generate new
HTML.

**Generate HTML files**:

```sh
# Enter folder
$ cd doc/manual

# Build
$ mkdocs build

# Open result in default browser
$ xdg-open html/index.html
```
